# Clock

This is my personal clock. It runs military time, and is currently very limited
but features are planned.

## Getting Started

Follow installation instructions for the following libraries:

- [avrm](https://github.com/nixpulvis/avrm)
- [max7221](https://github.com/nixpulvis/max7221)
- [ds1307](https://github.com/nixpulvis/ds1307)

Then flash the firmware:

```sh
sudo make military.flash
```
